# GUI-Salary
This Java program creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to display hourly and yearly salary information. It utilizes Swing components such as JFrame, JLabel, and JTextField to construct the interface. The layout is managed using GridBagLayout and GridBagConstraints for precise control over component placement.

Upon execution, the program generates a window titled "Salary" containing two labels (wageLabel and salLabel) and two text fields (wageField and salField). The wageField displays the hourly wage, while the salField displays the calculated yearly salary based on the hourly wage assumption (in this case, $20 per hour, 40 hours per week, and 50 weeks per year).

The components are arranged in a grid layout with specified constraints to control their positioning and spacing. The program terminates gracefully when the window is closed.

To run the program, compile the GUI.java file and execute it. This simple GUI serves as a foundation for more complex user interfaces and demonstrates basic Swing GUI development in Java.
